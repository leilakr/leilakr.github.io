## About Me

I am a tech compliance specialist with a background in law and startups. 

I consult on regulatory matters for the huge influx of new projects that are springing forward in this advent of AI agents and automation. 

I give people clear feedback on how to make sure their projects are legal (and act as a kind of human guardrail for the GenAI compliance hallucinations that sometimes pop up).

When not online, I am cooking or birdwatching (bringing more enthusiasm than skill to both activities).
